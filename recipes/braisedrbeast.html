    Prep time for this is about 25 minutes, or up to 45 minutes if you plan to french trim your lamb shanks. Cook time is ~1 hour, 45 minutes. This makes 4 servings.

OPENING

    Season your lamb with salt and pepper.
    Put a pan on high heat and add in your butter.
    Sear the lamb for about 30 seconds each side, or until brown.
    Place lamb in a large baking dish. Pour in your red wine and stock. You should have enough liquid to cover 3/4 of the lamb shanks.

MID GAME

    Preheat your oven to 350F.
    Place your garlic in the baking dish.
    Place the entire baking dish in the oven and bake for 1 hour.

LATE GAME

    After an hour, flip over the lamb shanks.
    Add in your chopped vegetables and continue baking for the remaining 45 minutes.
    Remove from the oven and plate the lamb shanks and vegetables.
    Pour the remaining liquid into a pan and reduce on high heat for about 5 minutes.
    Drizzle the reduced red wine sauce over the lamb. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the plate.
    Eat!
